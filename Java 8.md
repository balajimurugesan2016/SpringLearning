## Functional Interfaces
_Functional interfaces_ provide target types for lambda expressions and method references.

They are function with just an abstract method or an abstract method with static method implementation. The main advantage of using them is the ease of use in lambda operators or method references.

```
Interface MyFnInterface{
public abstract method apply();
}
```
