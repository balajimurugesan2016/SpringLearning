## Functional Interfaces
_Functional interfaces_ provide target types for lambda expressions and method references.

They are function with just a single abstract method or an abstract method with static & default method implementation. The main advantage of using them is the ease of use in lambda operators or method references.

```
Interface MyFnInterface{
public abstract method apply();
}
```
